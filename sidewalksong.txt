You fall over the sidewalk. It happens; those cracks leap in cement waves. The sky is wet tonight but your shoes are dry. 

Your jeans split and grass and pebbles burn skin. But your shoes are still dry and your dirty palms push you back up onto your feet. Your head wavers and you laugh to center yourself. 

Your face is wet tonight but your eyes are tiny dark sparks darting in every direction.

The world turns sturdy.

Tonight it’s all right to be the girl walking alone, hoodie pulled over your head as if you’re a boy, nearly a man, striding towards his next fix past a world not worthy of his attention. 

But those tiny burning eyes see everything that is and could be and the shadows are wonderful somehow.

Blood trickles down and slickens your shoes. Your hand touches a fallen leaf pressed against your cheek. Your fingers follow the ridged veins, like roadways. 

You have begun to love this world tonight.
